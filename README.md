## New Diversity Metrics

Code for the manuscript

This currently has two examples:

* **Wadden Example**: data from the Wadden Sea, which is used to demonstrate the collection of metrics.
* **GDMGLM**: Which shows how to ask the same questions as GDM using our statistics.

The data are in the `data/` folder


[The names of the metrics spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BXaXJMeGVVWC2vVJb8OIMYnge0IWzCkMZaFMOdqyAaw/edit?usp=sharing). 
This should end up being a table. It can be used and mis-used to get everything in order.
