abstract = {Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data (presence– absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base functions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination; hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses about the variation of community composition among sites. The theoretical developments and simulation results led to the following observations: (1) the variance of a community composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the variance of the community composition table nor a measure of beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should not be used to study the variation in community composition among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in community composition explained by the raw-data approach, and (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition among sites, is canonical partitioning. The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses, such as the variation in beta diversity among groups of sites. Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting models to similarity decay plots.},

abstract = {Abstract Turnover, or change in the composition of species over space and time, is one of the primary ways to define beta diversity. Inferring what factors impact beta diversity is not only important for understanding biodiversity processes but also for conservation planning. At present, a popular approach to understanding the drivers of compositional turnover is through generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). We argue that the current GDM approach suffers several limitations and provide an alternative modelling approach that remedies these issues. We propose using generative spatial random effects models implemented in a Bayesian framework. We offer hierarchical specifications to yield full regression and spatial predictive inference, both with associated full uncertainties. The approach is illustrated by examining dissimilarity in three datasets: tree survey data from Panama's Barro Colorado Island (BCI), plant occurrence data from southwest Australia and plant abundance surveys from the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa. We select a best model using out-of-sample predictive performance. We find that the form of the best model differs across the three datasets, but our models provide performance ranging from comparable to significant improvement over GDMs. Within the GCFR, the spatial random effects play a more important role in the modelling than all the environmental variables. We have proposed a model that provides several improvements to the current GDM framework. This includes advantages such as a flexible spatially varying mean function, spatial random effects that capture dependence unaccounted for by explanatory variables, and spatially heterogeneous variance structure. All these features are offered in a model that can adequately handle a large incidence of total dissimilarity through ‘one-inflation’, as would be expected from highly biodiverse areas with steep turnover gradients.}

    abstract = "{Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations, distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping, derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.}",

We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.}}

abstract = {Nestedness analysis has become increasingly popular in the study of biogeographic patterns of species occurrence. Nested patterns are those in which the species composition of small assemblages is a nested subset of larger assemblages. For species interaction networks such as plant–pollinator webs, nestedness analysis has also proven a valuable tool for revealing ecological and evolutionary constraints. Despite this popularity, there has been substantial controversy in the literature over the best methods to define and quantify nestedness, and how to test for patterns of nestedness against an appropriate statistical null hypothesis. Here we review this rapidly developing literature and provide suggestions and guidelines for proper analyses. We focus on the logic and the performance of different metrics and the proper choice of null models for statistical inference. We observe that traditional ‘gap-counting’ metrics are biased towards species loss among columns (occupied sites) and that many metrics are not invariant to basic matrix properties. The study of nestedness should be combined with an appropriate gradient analysis to infer possible causes of the observed presence–absence sequence. In our view, statistical inference should be based on a null model in which row and columns sums are fixed. Under this model, only a relatively small number of published empirical matrices are significantly nested. We call for a critical reassessment of previous studies that have used biased metrics and unconstrained null models for statistical inference.},

abstract = {Nestedness has been widely reported for both metacommunities and networks of interacting species. Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure.},

@article{AtmarPatterson1993,
	abstract = {Species distribution patterns within naturally fragmented habitat have been found to often exhibit patterns of pronounced nestedness. Highly predictable extinction sequences are implied by these nested species distribution patterns, thus the patterns are important to both the philosophy and practice of conservation biology. A simple thermodynamic measure of the order and disorder apparent in the nested patterns is described. The metric offers (i) a measure of the uncertainty in species extinction order, (ii) a measure of relative populational stabilities, (iii) a means of identifying minimally sustainable population sizes, and (iv) an estimate of the historical coherence of the species assemblage. Four presumptions govern the development of the metric and its theory: (i) the fragmented habitat was once whole and originally populated by a single common source biota, (ii) the islands were initially uniform in their habitat heterogeneity and type mix, and have remained so throughout their post-fragmentation history, (iii) no significant clinal (latitudinal) gradation exists across the archipelago so as to promote species turnover across the archipelago, and (iv) all species of interest are equally isolated on all islands. The violation of these conditions promotes species distributions which are idiosyncratic to the general extinction order expected in fragmentation archipelagos. While some random variation in extinction order is to be expected, idiosyncratic distributional patterns differ from randomness and are readily segregatable from such noise. A method of identifying idiosyncratic species and sites is described.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim: Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation  I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion  Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.},

Innovation  A novel method that disentangles all compositional differences (βcc, overall beta diversity) in its two components, species replacement (β-3) and species richness differences (βrich) is proposed. The performance of the method was studied with ternary plots, which allow visualization of the influence of the relative proportions of shared and unique species of two sites over each metric. The method was also tested in different hypothetical gradients and with real datasets. The novel method was compared with a previous proposal based on the partitioning of overall compositional differences (βsor) in replacement (βsim) and nestedness (βnes). The linear response of βcc contrasts with the curvilinear response of βsor to linear gradients of dissimilarity. When two sites did not share any species, βsim was always 1 and β-3 only reached 1 when the number of exclusive species of both sites was equal. β-3 remained constant along gradients of richness differences with constant replacement, while βsim decreased. βrich had a linear response to a linear gradient of richness differences with constant species replacement, whereas βnes exhibited a hump-shaped response. Moreover, βsim > βnes when clearly almost all species of one site were lost, whereas β-3 < βrich in the same circumstances. Main conclusions  The behaviour of the partition of βcc into β-3 and βrich is consistent with the variation of replacement and richness differences. The partitioning of βsor into βsim and βnes overestimates the replacement component and underestimates richness differences. The novel methodology allows the discrimination of different causes of beta-diversity patterns along latitudinal, biogeographic or ecological gradients, by estimating correctly the relative contributions of replacement and richness differences.},

Here, we suggest a slightly refined version of such a measure of nestedness and study how it is influenced by the most basic structural properties of networks, such as degree distribution and degree-degree correlations (i.e. assortativity). We find that most of the empirically found nestedness stems from heterogeneity in the degree distribution. Once such an influence has been discounted – as a second factor – we find that nestedness is strongly correlated with disassortativity and hence – as random networks have been recently found to be naturally disassortative – they also tend to be naturally nested just as the result of chance.},

In this study, we assessed the statistical performance of eight nestedness metrics and six null model algorithms. The metrics and algorithms were tested against a benchmark set of 200 random matrices and 200 nested matrices that were created by passive sampling. Many algorithms that have been used in nestedness studies are vulnerable to type I errors (falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis). The best-performing algorithm maintains fixed row and fixed column totals, but it is conservative and may not always detect nestedness when it is present. Among the eight indices, the popular matrix temperature metric did not have good statistical properties. Instead, the Brualdi and Sanderson discrepancy index and Cutler's index of unexpected presences performed best. When used with the fixed-fixed algorithm, these indices provide a conservative test for nestedness. Although previous studies have revealed a high frequency of nestedness, a reanalysis of 288 empirical matrices suggests that the true frequency of nested matrices is between 10\% and 40\%.},

Despite this, the relative contributions of various assembly processes to the observed β-diversity patterns, as well as the influence of plant traits on these contributions, are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the leaf/root-associated fungal communities across nine coexisting dominant herbaceous perennials in a temperate grassland that had undergone a 17-year mowing treatment. We elucidated the β-diversity components and community assembly processes of these fungal communities. Furthermore, we explored relationships between leaf/root functional trait variations and fungal community assemblies. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) both species turnover and nestedness are important components of the fungal β-diversity, with selection predominating in the fungal community assemblies; (2) mowing enhances the contributions of nestedness/selection; (3) plant trait variations significantly affect the fungal community assembly processes. Unexpectedly, our findings demonstrated a predominance of leaf/root fungal species turnover among coexisting plant hosts, contrasting with nestedness. Moreover, dispersal limitation emerged as the primary factor shaping fungal community assemblies, rather than selection processes. Although mowing significantly inhibited plant growth, its effects on the overall patterns of fungal assemblages were limited. We further observed that higher degrees of plant trait variations were primarily linked to stronger dispersal limitation, with a relatively weaker influence on heterogeneous selection. Additionally, the impact of plant traits on the selection process of root-associated fungi was more pronounced compared to that of leaf-associated fungi. Synthesis. Our study reveals that the β-diversity of fungi associated with coexisting plants in natural grasslands is primarily attributed to fungal species replacement rather than gain-and-loss dynamics among these plants. Concurrently, this observed pattern is largely governed by dispersal limitation as opposed to selection. We propose that the primary mechanism through which plant hosts and their traits influence the structures of associated fungal communities is by limiting fungal dispersal, while niche differentiation among fungal taxa plays a secondary role. These findings offer a mechanistic insight into the assemblies of plant mycobiomes and further elucidate the plant-mycobiome relationships within complex plant communities.}

abstract = {The three-dimensional rarity typology proposed by Rabinowitz in 1981, based on geographic range, habitat specificity, and local abundance, is among the most widely used frameworks for describing rarity in ecological and conservation research. While this framework is descriptive and is not meant to explain the causes of rarity, recent advances in ecology may be leveraged to add explanatory power. Here we present a macroecological exploration of rarity and its underlying causes. We propose a modification of Rabinowitz's typology to better distinguish between the dimensions of rarity and the ecological processes that drive them, and explore the conservation implications of our modified framework. We propose to add occupancy (the proportion of occupied sites within a species' range) as a rarity axis, and recast habitat specificity as a cause of rarity, thus yielding a modified classification based on range size, occupancy, and local abundance. Under our framework, habitat specialists are no longer considered rare if they are widespread and abundant; we argue that this modification more accurately identifies truly rare species, as habitat specialists may be common if their habitat is abundant. Finally, we draw on the macroecological and theoretical literature to identify the key processes and associated traits that drive each rarity axis. In this respect, we identify four processes (environmental filtering, movement, demography and interactions), and hypothesise that range size and occupancy are primarily driven by environmental filtering and movement, whereas local abundance is more strongly influenced by demography and interactions. We further use ecological theory to hypothesise the conservation concerns associated with each rarity axis, and propose conservation measures that may be suitable for conserving different types of rare species. Our work may provide a basis for developing hypotheses about the causes of rarity of particular focal taxa or groups, and inform the development of targeted conservation strategies.},
